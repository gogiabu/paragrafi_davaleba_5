    <h4>about</h4>
    <p><small>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.
        Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.
        Designers are toolmakers.
        Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.
        Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
        Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</small></p>
